# Web-Based Weather Forecasting App

This project entails developing a Django-based web application for weather forecasting. Users input their location to view a 5-day weather forecast with intuitive visualization. By leveraging machine learning algorithms trained on historical weather data, the application provides accurate predictions. The benefits include empowering users with accessible and reliable weather information for planning activities. Through seamless integration of Django backend and frontend technologies, the project aims to deliver a user-friendly and informative weather forecasting experience.
